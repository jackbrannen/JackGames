        content: `Generate 50 Drawful-style drawing prompts for a party game. Each should be a specific, concrete scene that would be funny to draw and guess.

Rules:
- Each prompt has exactly one absurd element — one normal thing in a weird situation, or one weird thing in a normal situation. Don't stack two or more absurdities.
- No letters, numbers, or text-based humor — prompts must be drawable.
- Vary prompt length — some should be 2–3 words, some 4–6, some longer. Don't let any one length dominate.
- Vary structure: at least 10 should be compound nouns or hybrid objects ("half X, half Y"), at least 10 should be location/situation-based ("inside a X, a Y is happening"), and the rest can be "a [character] doing [wrong thing]" style.
- At least 10 prompts must use the placeholder [Player] (exactly as written, with square brackets) in place of a specific person's name. The [Player] slot will be filled in with a real player's name at game time. Examples: "[Player] being chased through a mall by a goose", "a judge sentencing [Player] for stealing a cracker", "the moment [Player] realized the bear was friendly". Use [Player] only once per prompt, and make sure it's a scene that's still clearly drawable.
- Do not number the prompts.

Format: one prompt per line, no numbering, no quotes, no punctuation at the end.${excludeSection}`,
